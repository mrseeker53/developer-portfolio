            <h3>Day Dreamer and Sleepy Traveller</h3>
            <p>I dream on the day time and wish for travelling. But nobody pays me for that work. In reality, I want to
                travel with my macbook that's why I start learning web development. I already love it so I wish I
                would be a great software engineer near future.</p>

            <h3>Become a software engineer</h3>
            <p>I already learned basic HTML and CSS. I can create any simple website. The next step is to create three
                basic websites and lots of practice with learning advanced topics. My focus is on full stack development
                especially back end development.
